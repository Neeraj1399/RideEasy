// backend/config/cloudinary.js
// This file no longer needs to call cloudinary.config() or export anything for configuration.
// Its role (if any) is now just a placeholder, or it can be deleted.

// You can remove all previous code from this file.
// For example:
// import { v2 as cloudinary } from "cloudinary";
// cloudinary.config({ ... });
// export default cloudinary;
